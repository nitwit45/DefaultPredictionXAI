# Research Trends CourseWork 1

## Introduction
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the financial sector, revolutionizing decision-making, risk management, and customer service. This GitHub repository explores the impact of AI, particularly Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), in finance. The integration of XAI addresses the complexity and regulatory nature of the financial industry, providing transparency and interpretability to AI models.

## Objectives
This repository aims to examine emerging trends and implications of AI in finance, with a focus on XAI. A literature survey, technical advancements, and real-world examples are presented to provide a comprehensive overview of the past, present, and future of XAI in the financial landscape.

## Prototype
We have developed a prototype for this project, located in the "prototype" folder. The prototype demonstrates practical applications of XAI in finance, showcasing its potential in fraud detection, credit scoring, bankruptcy prediction, and stock market analysis.
